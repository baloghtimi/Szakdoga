	abstract="Small languages are gaining popularity in the software engineering community. The development of MOF and EMF has given the Domain Specific Language community a tremendous boost. In this tutorial the basic aspects of model driven engineering in combination with Domain Specific Languages will be discussed. The focus is on textual Domain Specific Languages developed using the language invention pattern. The notion of abstract syntax will be linked to metamodels as well as the definition of concrete syntax. Defining static and dynamic semantics will be discussed. A small but non trivial Domain Specific Language SLCO will be used to illustrate our ideas.",

Different patterns of model synchronization are analyzed (including view updates and incremental synchronization), and this analysis motivates the formal definitions. Relationships between the formal models are precisely specified and discussed. A new formal model of updates is proposed.",
